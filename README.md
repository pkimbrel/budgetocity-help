# Welcome to Budgetocity!

### Budgeting with a twist.

**Budgetocity** offers a unique experience for helping you manage your budget.  While most budgeting software will budget from month-to-month, **Budgetocity** gives you the option to budget based on how frequently you are paid.

If you're paid monthly, you can budget monthly.  However...

If you're paid bi-weekly, you have the option to budget every 4 weeks.  This gives you unique opportunity to find "unused" money in your paycheck that results from having monthly bills.  This is a better solution for people paid bi-weekly that experience the dreaded "third paycheck" in a monthly budgeting system.  You can use that money pay off debts or save for future expenses.  

For folks that are paid on an erratic basis, Budgetocity also offers a "custom" budget period that allows you to adjust each budget period to your unique circumstance.

Budgetocity is based on the philosophy of **zero-based** budget.  That is, every dollar you earn you should be accounted for in a budget.  By building your budget around when you get paid, rather than when you have bills, you have the opportunity to properly utilize every dollar you earn.  The goal is to tell your money where to go, rather than discovering where your money went.

### But that's just the beginning...

Budgetocity offers a variety of tools to help you get control of your money.  This isn't fancy accounting software.  It's simple, straight-forward budgeting with you in mind.
