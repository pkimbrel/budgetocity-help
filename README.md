# Welcome to Budgetocity!

## Overview

**Budgetocity** offers a unique experience for helping you manage your budget. While most budgeting software will budget from month-to-month, **Budgetocity** gives you the option to budget based on how frequently you are paid.

If you're paid monthly, you can budget monthly. However...

If you're paid bi-weekly, you have the option to budget every 4 weeks. This gives you unique opportunity to find "unused" money in your paycheck that results from having monthly bills. This is a better solution for people paid bi-weekly that experience the dreaded "third paycheck" in a monthly budgeting system. You can use that money pay off debts or save for future expenses.

Additionally, for folks that are paid on an erratic basis, Budgetocity also offers a "custom" budget period that allows you to adjust each budget period to your unique circumstance.

Budgetocity is based on the philosophy of **zero-based** budget. That is, every dollar you earn you should be accounted for in a budget. By building your budget around when you get paid, rather than when you have bills, you have the opportunity to properly utilize every dollar you earn. The goal is to tell your money where to go, rather than discovering where your money went.

## But that's just the beginning...

Budgetocity offers a variety of tools to help you get control of your money. This isn't fancy accounting software. This is simple, straight-forward budgeting with _**you**_ in mind.

_Here are some highlights of the other features you will find in Budgetocity..._

### Planning

You can enter all your monthly expenses regardless of your budgeting plan. Armed with your expense information, Budgetocity can help you ensure that every bill gets paid.

As a bonus to those who budget every 4-weeks, you will discover that some expenses "fall between" budget periods. This is literally free money that you can use for paying off debt, saving for a vacation, etc.

### Budget Summary

If you budget with a significant-other, you need to stay informed of your more fluid expenses, like groceries or gas money. The summary gives you the ability to choose what you want to quickly see when you start Budgetocity.

### Tagging

Tagging is an advanced feature of Budgetocity that allows you to apply tags to your spending. While each spending transaction has a "category", tags provide an additional dimension to your organization. Tagging is useful for folks that use multiple credit/debit cards or accounts to pay for items, but want to maintain a zero-based budget.
