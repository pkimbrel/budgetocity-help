# Signing Up

To get registered Budgetocity, you will need to provide a little information.  You can change this information later if you find it is incorrect.

* Your name
* Preferred user name
* A working email address
* A password

You will also need to provide some information about your checking account:

* **Account name**: Whatever you want to call it. Examples: Checking, Name of your bank, Blueberries, etc. 
* **Starting Balance**: Your account's starting balance.  Your checking account's current balance will be fine.  If you need to adjust it later, if necessary. 
* **Account Buffer**: This is an optional amount you want to keep in your account when your budget is spent.  This helps keeps you from accidentally overspending on your account. 
* **Budget Frequency**: This is what makes Budgetocity unique!  Typically, folks budget _monthly_ - and you can do that here.  However, you can also choose _quad-weekly_ which works better if you get paid **every two weeks**.    You can also choose _custom_, which will require another option - **Paycheck Duration** - which is the length of your first budget. 
* **First Paycheck Date**: This is the date you want to start Budgetocity.  You can pick the most recent paycheck you have already received, or you can pick your next paycheck.  Getting started is a little different depending on which way you go.  Another way to think of this date is your first budget.
