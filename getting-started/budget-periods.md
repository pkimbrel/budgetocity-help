# Budget Periods

Since Budgetocity allows, but does not force you, to budget monthly, you will not see any thing about a "Monthly Budget".  Instead, you will see references to a **"Budget Period"**.  A budget period is any chunk of time you wish to budget.  That could a month.  That could be 4 weeks \(for folks that get paid every 2 weeks\), or it could be a custom period of time of your choosing.

Remember - every budget is a "Period".

As you go from budget period to budget period, the budgets will be labeled sequentially, "Period-1", "Period-2", "Period-3", etc.
